**Will's Lively Villages** is a mod that breathes life into Minecraft villages by adding unique villager names, immersive village naming, and increased protection for the golems who live within them.

## Features

### Biome-Specific Villager Names
With **Will's Lively Villages**, villagers across different biomes now have unique **first and last names** to add more personality to your village inhabitants.

- Each biome has **hundreds of names** to choose from, giving your villagers a true identity and making them feel more alive.
- **Name tags** can no longer be used on villagers since they now come with their own given names.

### Biome-Specific Village Names
Each village you come across will now be named according to the biome in which it is generated. Upon entering a village its name will appear, creating a sense of place and belonging.

- Over **300 unique village names** are available per biome, making each village you encounter feel distinct and special.
- Names are displayed only when you enter the village, enhancing the immersion without disrupting your exploration.

### Villagers Repair Iron Golems
Villagers are now more engaged in **protecting their homes**. They actively help repair **damaged iron golems**, ensuring your village's defenses remain strong.

- Villagers will gather around iron golems to repair them, ensuring that golems can continue protecting the village.
- You'll notice **healing particles** and sounds as villagers work to keep the golems in top condition, adding to the atmosphere of a bustling and well-defended village.

## Compatibility

**Will's Lively Villages** should support the majority of other village/villager mods. Including those that add more villager professions, village structures and generate villages in new biomes.
